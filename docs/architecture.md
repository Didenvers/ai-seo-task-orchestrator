# Architecture Overview

This project follows a planning-first AI architecture.

- Human provides a high-level goal
- AI Orchestrator decomposes it into tasks
- Tasks are validated and stored
- Execution is delegated to specialized agents (future scope)

Core principle:
AI plans work — agents execute it.
